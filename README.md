### User Stories

#### MVP

1. User can see an 'index page' that includes 'index cards' of terms.
2. User can utilize a search bar at the top of the page that searches the index cards below.
3. User can also scroll through these terms to search for their desired term.
4. User can click on each term, which will reveal information, such as the definition, associated/suggested ABA methods, and resources to help guide the user through each situation.
5. Once user is done with this index card, they can click a 'back home' button to navigate back to the 'index page'.

#### STRETCH GOALS

1. Add 100+ terms to the app, so it might actually be useful out of the gate (nothing really like this exists, so I would really like to focus on expanding on the information of each index card to really try and make it useful for the user.
2. Add a 'Get Help Near Me' button that provides a googlemap of professionals within a certain radius.
3. Add other buttons to donate to Autism Speaks and Special Olympics.
